These scripts were crafted for custom use and might
not be quite useful by themselves. They try to automate
the setting up of a new laptop a little by:

* Helping with the installation of the packages
* Configuring some tools
* Installing some helper scripts

They also contain some other scripts which are used less frequently.
In case you find anything to be brought to notice in the issues page.
