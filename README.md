lxconf: linux laptop configuration scripts
---

These scripts were crafted for custom use and might
not be quite useful by themselves. You may consider
it to be another example (pet) shell project.

In case you find anything to be brought to notice,
[bring it up](https://github.com/sivaraam/lxconf/issues/new).
